# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 16, 2021

**Today's Goals**: Today goals are to continue where i left freeCodeCamp program (Survey Form). And get more familiar with CSS Responsive and Flexbox.

**Today's Progress**: Survey Form done. It doesn't look great but i do think it's good enough and I did learn a couple of things.

**Thoughts**: Feeling good about starting the challenge. Stoping the excuses and starting from the basics.
