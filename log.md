# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 16, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Survey Form done. It doesn't look great but i do think it's good enough and I did learn a couple of things.

**Thoughts**: Feeling good about starting the challenge. Stoping the excuses and starting from the basics.

### Day 2: April 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued with some CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid. Kinda stuck but still learning a lot.

**Thoughts**: Not an easy day, I kept trying to use Flexbox only and couldn't figure things out.

### Day 3: April 18, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Almost done with FCC Landing Page, I hope to finish it tomorrow. Not sure if I am doing things the best way but I am doing them.

**Thoughts**: It is amazing how much easier it has been for me to get work done since I started the challenge. I don't know if at some point burnout can kick in but so far im really happy with it.

### Day 4: April 19, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Still on FCC Landing Page. I learned that I should look more often the console for the Computed Styles when I find something is not working the way I expected.

**Thoughts**: Another kinda stuck day. I did take some time to learn about the Agile Manifesto and the idea behind it.

### Day 5: April 20, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Decided to start over the styling for FCC Landing Page as I was having some problems I couldn't find the way to fix.

**Thoughts**: I think I was changing too much classes to make sure it was very clear and ended up making a big mess.

### Day 6: April 21, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 85% in to JavaScript Basic on FCC. I have done good progress with the Landing Page also.

**Thoughts**: Thought that starting with JavaScript would give me a litle break from CSS. It has been a good decision.
