# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 16, 2021

**Today's Goals**: Today goals are to continue where i left freeCodeCamp program (Survey Form). And get more familiar with CSS Responsive and Flexbox.

**Today's Progress**: Survey Form done. It doesn't look great but i do think it's good enough and I did learn a couple of things.

**Thoughts**: Feeling good about starting the challenge. Stoping the excuses and starting from the basics.

### Day 2: April 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued with some CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid. Kinda stuck but still learning a lot.

**Thoughts**: Not an easy day, I kept trying to use Flexbox only and couldn't figure things out.

### Day 3: April 18, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Almost done with FCC Landing Page, I hope to finish it tomorrow. Not sure if I am doing things the best way but I am doing them.

**Thoughts**: It is amazing how much easier it has been for me to get work done since I started the challenge. I don't know if at some point burnout can kick in but so far im really happy with it.
